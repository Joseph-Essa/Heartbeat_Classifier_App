# Heartbeat Classifier App

## Overview
The Heartbeat Classifier App is a machine learning application that analyzes ECG images to classify heartbeats into normal and various types of arrhythmias. The application employs a two-step classification process to ensure accurate diagnosis.

## Application Structure
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Qt Designer
- **Models**:
  - **Binary Classification Model**: XGBClassifier to detect if the heartbeat is normal or abnormal.
  - **Multiclass Classification Model**: Random Forest to classify abnormal heartbeats into one of the following categories:
    - Supraventricular Premature Beat (S)
    - Ventricular Premature Beat (V)
    - Fusion of Ventricular and Normal Beat (F)
    - Unknown Beat (Q)

## Datasets
- **Use Dataset**: [Heartbeat Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)
- **Testing Dataset**: [ECG Image Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erhmrai/ecg-image-data)
- **Note**: The training dataset is imbalanced, which is why a two-model approach was utilized for improved classification performance.

## Features
- Image upload for heartbeat analysis.
- Extraction of 187 features from ECG images.
- Visualization of heartbeat patterns.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

2. Launch the Qt Designer frontend to upload ECG images for classification:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
